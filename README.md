An application that allows users to upload images and videos and compress
them to a lower size. :)


# Development
---

All dependancies required to run the project is under <code>pom.xml</code>

External Dependancies include:

    1) Jama(SVD Library)
    2) AWS (AWS S3 Main Storage)
    3) Cloudinary(Alternate Storage)
    4) Java XML Binding API (AWS Dependancy)

Most Java Integrated Development Enviorements such as Eclipse, STS, and Intelji support maven hence all dependancies should be automatically installed once imported.
